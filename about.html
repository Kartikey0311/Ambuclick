        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>
            During the development of AmbuClick, the creators faced various challenges, including ensuring a user-friendly
            interface, addressing cross-browser compatibility issues, and optimizing the website for performance. Through
            perseverance and innovation, we overcame these challenges to deliver a reliable and efficient
            platform for emergency healthcare.The major challenge faced by us was when we tried to complete the code together ,
            sharing of files became an issue for us as we had no prior knowledge of github . We wanted to have a experience similar to 
            canva where one can design together with his/her team members.
